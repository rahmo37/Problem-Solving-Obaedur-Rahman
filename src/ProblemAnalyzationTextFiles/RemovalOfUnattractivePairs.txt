Conditions and main Points

* A pair of adjacent characters can be removed if, and only if, they are different.

* Only directly adjacent characters in the string can be considered for deletion in each step.

* After each deletion, the string is re-evaluated for further adjacent pairs that can be deleted.

* The process stops when no more pairs of different adjacent characters are available for deletion.

* The goal is to minimize the length of the string through these deletions.

* Multiple valid sequences of deletions can exist, leading to the same minimum length.
